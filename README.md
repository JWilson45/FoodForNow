# FoodForNow

## Summary of Idea

Food for now will be a way to easily store recipes that you like, and all of the individual ingredients and proportions that are needed to recreate it.

Will be able to rename the ingredients, or name the ingredients whatever they want. If they choose to nickname it, the original name of the ingredient will be preserved. Then when matching a recipe with ingredients, it will use the actual ingredient name instead of the nickname. Maybe it will also look for the nickname. Suggest multiple recipes if they both match different recipes.

Will be able to share recipes with others in the future, will probably need to create a database that stores all of the individual food names that users enter.

Will suggest recipes that match what you have in your kitchen. Users can enter the contents of their kitchen to have recipes suggested that they can make on the spot.

At some point it will give groceries shopping suggestions and show the meals that can be made if they pick up a certain ingredient. If you want to make a certain meal, you can have it add anything that you don't already have in your house. you can also add anything you want to the grouchier list... of course. And share that list with others

Sharing will have to be seamless, if its hard to share lists with others then whats the point. It should export to textto iMessage or email or whatever and link to the app. it would be cool if it could export a bullet list to notes, or have an iMessage widget with an updating checklist. Have to have widgets for the home screen


There will need to be a way to easily remove items from your kitchen, not making it a labor intensive task to go through every item in your kitchen if you have a lot.

Items in kitchen will be stored on users phone unless they allow us to store them in the cloud.

Sign in with apple is the only simple sign in to start, also have a standard email password setup.
