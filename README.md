# FoodForNow

FoodForNow (Temporary Name) will be a database based project where entering food\
existing in ones possession will return results of recipes that can be made from the input

It will also work in reverse, where recipes can be looked up which allows the \
user to avoid scrolling through __annoying__ pages of ads and unnecessary text found on most recipe websites.

```
console.log(Hello World)
```

*This is a __tab__ friendly environment*
